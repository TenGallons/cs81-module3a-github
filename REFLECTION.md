# Reflection: Git & GitHub

## What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?
I learned the workflow of staging changes with git add, saving checkpoints with git commit, and uploading my work to GitHub with git push.

## What was most confusing or frustrating?
The staging step was confusing at first because files don’t get committed automatically, so I had to remember the correct order of commands.

## Why do you think developers use Git?
Git helps developers track changes, undo mistakes, and collaborate without overwriting each other’s work.

## How might this help with larger projects in the future?
Commits act like checkpoints, and GitHub makes it easier to manage lots of changes and work with other people.
